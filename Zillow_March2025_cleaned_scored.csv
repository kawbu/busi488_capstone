Owner-occupied for the past three years.  New carpet put in 2.5 years ago, all ceilings and all walls repainted.  New vinyl and new toilet put into master bathroom 2 months ago.  This is not a ""fixer-upper"" property by any means.  It is move-in ready right now.  

This property is versatile.  It can be used as investment/rental unit or family/individual owner living.  It is very hard to find 3 BR properties under $100k in Chapel Hill, and this is about as affordable as it gets to still be located in the middle of Chapel Hill.

The complex is located only 1.4 miles away from the center of Franklin St. and Columbia/MLK.  The complex is on the ""N"" busline.  The new Carolina North campus will be built less than a mile away from Bolinwood.  UNC main campus is located very close to the condo.  Other amenities include pool, laundry, tennis courts, basketball courts, and a city-maintained park that you can walk to in less than 5 minutes.

If you qualify for the $8,000 first-time homebuyer credit, this would be a great way to use it.  The credit increases your tax refund by $8,000 (again, as long as you qualify) if you live in the home for 3 years, and can be claimed prior to filing your 2009 return by amending your 2008 return (then you would get the money immediately instead of waiting until April 15th rolls around to file).  $8,000 goes a long way when you have a mortgage that is less than $100,000.
